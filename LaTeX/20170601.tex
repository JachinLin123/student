	As is widely known to us all that the relationship between parents and children plays a significant role in a family, which not only serves as a crucial bridge to build trust and connection between the two generations but also exerts a profound and subtle influence on children’s personal growth.
	
	In order to enhance the relationship, it is essential to cultivate the respect between parents and children. Furthermore, it is of great necessity for parents to spend more time accompanying their children, which will strengthen the affection between each other. Last but not least, it is wise for parents to set good examples instead of making demands on their children, in order to nurture children’s spiritual development.
	
	In sum, the sound relationship between parents and children requires the integration of numerous measures derived from the joint effort of parents, children and schools.
